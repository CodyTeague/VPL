This is a side project that I've been working on to manage a ping pong league at work.

Using Google Scripts with Google Sheets, I was able to create a system of managing game schedules, scores and record keeping.

Functionality thus far:
* Users can enter a game number and scores of ping pong games which are then entered into the schedule
* Standings in each division are calculated based on scores in the schedule and 
* Function to send out an email to each player that displays their games for the week

To Do:
* Test current functionality using Jest
* Actually automate the sending of emails
* Possibly fix overall framework to make it a little more fault tolerant
